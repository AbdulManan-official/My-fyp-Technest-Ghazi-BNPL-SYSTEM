          Technest Ghazi (BNPL System) is a revolutionary mobile application developed by a team of BSIT students at the College of Arts and Sciences (TCAS), Sialkot, with the aim of transforming the e-commerce experience in Pakistan. Our team, consisting of Abdul Manan, Muhammad Bilal, and Zaighum Abbass, worked diligently on this project to bridge the gap in the Pakistani market for Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) services.

        <Text style={styles.sectionTitle}>Our Journey</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Our journey began with the realization that many consumers face financial constraints when shopping online, particularly when it comes to purchasing electronics. Traditional payment methods often limit the ability of customers to buy the products they need, and we wanted to find a way to make shopping more accessible. This led to the creation of Technest Ghazi, a platform that allows users to shop for their desired products while offering flexible payment options like BNPL and Cash on Delivery (COD).

          Through this app, we hope to empower consumers by providing them with the flexibility they need to make purchases that are more suited to their financial capabilities. By integrating modern technology such as React Native for mobile development and Firebase for backend services, we have built an intuitive and secure platform for Ghazi Khan Electronics to reach a broader audience.

        <Text style={styles.sectionTitle}>The Story Behind Technest Ghazi</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          As students of BSIT at TCAS Sialkot, we were tasked with a project that would not only showcase our skills but also solve real-world problems. We noticed that many people in Pakistan, especially in smaller towns and cities, were limited by traditional payment methods. With the rise of e-commerce globally, we saw a significant opportunity to develop a flexible and accessible platform for online shopping.

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Our goal was to create a system where consumers could buy products they need without having to worry about immediate financial strain. Thus, Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) was integrated into the platform as a solution to help consumers afford purchases over time, easing their financial burden.
